# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2020-03-09

**Today's Progress:** 
Worked through Basic creating a website tutorial on LevelUpTuts' YouTube channel. Began building dummy landing page for LunchTimeLearning.tech

**Thoughts:** Feels weird to be such a beginner at front-end dev work.

### Day 2,3,4,5: 2020-03-14

**Today's Progress:** 
After a series of 16-hour days at the office, I was a bit behind on my 100 day coding. Caught up today by starting to work through the Gatsby tutorial. Lesson 1-4 complete and I am hooked.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of moving parts under the covers of React. I will definitely need to get a more fundamental understanding of the vanilla JS environment to really understand what is going on.

**Links:** https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/

### Day 6: 2020-03-15

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Gatsby tutorial. With various digressions along the way.

**Thoughts:** Realised, yet again, that there is a ton of stuff that happened in the Javascript world over the last few years while I was stuck in Java-land. The front-end journey is looking exciting.

**Links:** https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/

### Day 7, 8: 2020-03-17

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Responsive Web Design challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Now onto the projects.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid is really cool, but I'm struggling to fully graph when you would use flexbox and when CSS grid is more appropriate.

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 9, 10: 2020-03-19

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Tribute project (project 1 of 5) in the Responsive Web Design section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Jeepers, I needed to reference back to the material for almost everything.

**Links:** https://codepen.io/gregfullard1/pen/WNvKrLJ

### Day 11: 2020-03-20

**Today's Progress:**
Started basic Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running through them quickly, but actually learned a few things along the way. Just proves that you can always learn more.

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 12 & 13: 2020-03-22

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the landing page for LunchTimeLearning. Now onto the other pages: About, FAQ and Credits

**Thoughts:** Still a slow struggle, but was greatly helped by Gary Simon's videos on YouTube. Really think I should consider building a basic web page almost every day to get used to the various effects of CSS

**Links:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ln_PFw_dYU&t=663s

### Day 14: 2020-03-23

**Today's Progress:**
Got to 80/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running as fast as I can, all quite basic up to now

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 15: 2020-03-25

**Today's Progress:**
 Took yesterday off due to all the trauma related to the national lockdown. Back at it today though. Got to 101/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still very basic, but starting to have to think before I type. I like it.

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 16-18: 2020-03-28

**Today's Progress:**
Built the survey form project in the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert.

**Thoughts:** Building the form to pass the tests was very easy, but it took me quite a while to get the styling acceptable. Still a long road ahead before I feel comfortable on the front-end

**Links:** https://codepen.io/gregfullard1/pen/KKpbVMw

### Day 19: 2020-03-29

**Today's Progress:**
Finally got going on Neo4J. 

**Thoughts:** After much deliberation, I decided to select Neo4J as the database for the skills ontology I'm building for LunchTimeLearning. Other main candidate was JCR. 

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 20: 2020-04-01

**Today's Progress:**
Progressed with Neo4J

**Thoughts:** After a 2-day hold-up was finally able to spend sopme time on this project. Starting to grash Cypher queries used in Neo4J.  

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 21: 2020-04-02

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the Neo4J course, but started building the skills ontology using Cypher

**Thoughts:** Will be some time before I'm an absolute expert, but Neo4J is extremely intuitive  

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 22: 2020-04-03

**Today's Progress:**
Slow day, started working through @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges

**Thoughts:** Gonna need to do a lot of ES6 coding before this comes naturally to me. 

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6

### Day 23: 2020-04-04

**Today's Progress:**
Finished @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges. Lots of work on the Neo4J skills ontology for @DevSkillDojo.

**Thoughts:** Really suffering from shiny object syndrome, and struggling to get into a real flow state 

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6

### Day 24: 2020-04-05

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. finished the section on advanced Cycpher queries and now moving onto creating nodes and relationships.

**Thoughts:** Although Cypher is quite different from SQL, the best way to understand Cypher is to map the concepts to similar concepts in SQL.

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 25: 2020-04-07

**Today's Progress:**
Missed a day, but continuing with the @Neo4J course. Finished section 7 (Creating data). Now finally onto the last section before I can feel reasonably comfortable to actually build stuff.

**Thoughts:** Some days I'm really struggling to find time and motivation. Often I have one or the other. But having both is rare.

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 26: 2020-04-08

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. Looked at analysing queries with EXPLAIN and PROFILE. 

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the query to terminate from the second browser

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 27-28: 2020-04-10

**Today's Progress:**
With many stops and starts I finally completed the @Neo4J course. Ready to start using it properly

**Thoughts:** Just happy to be done

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 29: 2020-04-16

**Today's Progress:**
Took some days off to recover my Mojo. Spent this morning assembling the skeleton Cypher script for the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** As always, once you build your own stuff, you immediately notice the gaps in your knowledge, but this is a great way to learn more.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 30: 2020-04-17

**Today's Progress:**
Added the first proper graph relationships to the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** Baby steps

**Links:** N/A

### Day 31: 2020-04-18

**Today's Progress:**
Built a basic SpringBoot REST service which accesses the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology using Spring Data and the @Neo4J OGM Bolt driver.

**Thoughts:** The level of standardisation that Spring Data has brought to the party is really making polyglot persistence a reality

**Links:** N/A

### Day 32: 2020-04-19

**Today's Progress:**
Adding support for POST requests in the skills ontology service. Also added a Postman project to make consistent testing a bit easier.

**Thoughts:** Pulling relationships from the Neo4J graph is not working as expected yet, but will figure it out tomorrow

**Links:** N/A

### Day 33: 2020-04-20

**Today's Progress:**
Added SpringBoot REST methods for creating new skills (with specified perspective and parent). Also resolved issue which caused relationships not to serialize correctly to JSON.

**Thoughts:** as with all Object to JSON serialisation, there is a risk of massive trees of JSON going back. I might really need to investigate GraphQL instead of REST

**Links:** N/A

### Day 34: 2020-04-21

**Today's Progress:**
Refactored SpringBoot skills API slightly. Nothing earth-shaking, but cleaning up controllers and PathParams. Also changed the domain model slightly to allow the specification of prerequisite skills.

**Thoughts:** Need to work through a REST best practices book at some stage, just to ensure I'm doing things in the best possible way.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 35: 2020-04-22

**Today's Progress:**
Spent an hour trying to figure out why Spring Data Neo4J was not pulling related objects from the graph. And and just after posting to the newbie forum, I realised that the Cypher query did not return the relationship. Luckily they forum offers a delete option :)

**Thoughts:** Easy in the end, but weird how one starts doubting your own capabilities.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 36: 2020-04-23

**Today's Progress:**
Adding API method to create skills along with prerequisite skills, based on the weak-prerequisite relationship in the domain model.

**Thoughts:** Just a few more API method to go and then we can get into the Python side of things. Whoop whoop.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 37 & 38: 2020-04-25

**Today's Progress:**
Adding CRUD API methods for all lookup lists. Also began working on API method for registering learning resource providers and content creators.

**Thoughts:** Weird issue with handling Object Graph Mapping for recursive relationships. Need to dig a bit deeper.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 39 & 40: 2020-04-27

**Today's Progress:**
Finished all API methods for the skills ontology microservice. Next up is the Python code to begin populating this @Neo4J graph. Can't wait to see it running.

**Thoughts:** Might be necessary to change around the directions of relationships when I get more familiar with the domain model

**Links:** N/A

### Day 41 & 42: 2020-04-29

**Today's Progress:**
Following 2 solid days of coding I have completed most of the Python data upload scripts. In the process needed to refactor quite a number of the skills microservice methods. Just one more to go, let's hope the motivation lasts :)

**Thoughts:** Most complex of the lot now remains, and once I start building the web scraping it is very likely that the CSV formats will need to change.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 43 & 44: 2020-05-01

**Today's Progress:**
Another 2 days of pretty solid coding and I have finally completed the Python data upload scripts. Now I can begin populating the data sheets (manually and by web scraping) to build a comprehensive directory of technical skills and related learning resources.

**Thoughts:** Before I get lost in Web scraping, I should first build out the first set of data by hand. Just in case there are still minor adjustments needed in the model.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 45 & 46: 2020-05-03

**Today's Progress:**
Took it a bit easiers over the weekend. Started to clean up my @Neo4J data loading scripts and also got half-way with the regular expressions challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** None, really

**Links:** N/A

### Day 47 & 48: 2020-05-05

**Today's Progress:**
Finished regular expressions challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Also circled back to the Responsive Web Design Projects. Still need to finish 3.

**Thoughts:** My goodness, seems I have forgetten everything about CSS again :( And after a short stint on the back-end

**Links:** N/A

### Day 49: 2020-05-06

**Today's Progress:**
Still busy with the Project Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp. Struggling a bit to find sufficient time to really focus at the moment. HTML markup finished at least, but CSS file is still empty

**Thoughts:** To get good at this I will need to: Compile my own cheat sheets, Build at least one website per week

**Links:** N/A

### Day 50: 2020-05-22

**Today's Progress:**
After two weeks of absolute chaos with work and back-office finance, I am finally getting back on the horse by just doing random practice with creating pure HTML and CSS layouts. 

**Thoughts:** I want to get to the point that front-end markup and styling comes just as naturally as chirning out Java code

**Links:** N/A

### Day 51: 2020-06-11

**Today's Progress:**
Got back on the horse with the Ontology. Mainly just updating the readme and getting the solution to build

**Thoughts:** Realised the value of a good readme file for side-projects, because when you get back to a code-base for the first time in 3 weeks, you DO NOT want to spend the first hour just remembering how to bootstrap the app.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 52: 2020-06-12

**Today's Progress:**
Built a basic web scraper using Selenium for Java. 

**Thoughts:** Initially tried using JSoup, which is a Java port of the Python Beautiful Soup library. But had some issues with dynamically loaded page content, so then I switched to Selenium.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 53: 2020-06-13

**Today's Progress:**
Expanded the web scraper to be more robust, including catering for Udemy's blue-green deployment which returns different page layouts at random. Also writing the results into CSV

**Thoughts:** Lots of complexity with web scraping when data is loaded at runtime with Ajax calls

**Links:** N/A

### Day 54: 2020-06-14

**Today's Progress:**
Added some polish and then ran the web scraper the the "full" list of Udemy development courses. 

**Thoughts:** Final results successful, but it seems like they only show the first 10 000 records. Next step would be to do the searching/scraping at a more graunlar level and then aggregate the results. But still, quite chuffed that my code ran for 30 minutes, going through 625 pages and 10625 divs without a single exception.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 55: 2020-06-15

**Today's Progress:**
Ported the scraper over to a SpringBoot console app. Also improved logging and the ability to scrape individual Udemy categories and then aggregate them.

**Thoughts:** Scraped 21719 courses in 2.5 hours until the process terminated because it exceeded the configured number of errors allowed by the algorithm. Will run it overnight will a large number of allowed errors, just to see the total, but it seems like there are at least 40 000 courses on Udemy

**Links:** N/A

### Day 56: 2020-06-16

**Today's Progress:**
Switched track a little bit today and began working on some basic UI views for the ontology. Nothing fancy for now, just some SpringMVC with Thymeleaf templates

**Thoughts:** First time I've really done something with Thymeleaf and it is very similar to sightly

**Links:** N/A


### Day 57: 2020-06-17

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing on the UI effort, but kinda decided to use this opportunity to build some React skills as well. So I found a fandy course covering ful stack development using SpringBoot and React. Gonna take a few days to work through it fully, but seems like the type of content I need

**Thoughts:** N/A

**Links:** N/A

### Day 58: 2020-06-18

**Today's Progress:**
In addition to proceeding well on my SpringBoot/React learning, I've been spending a lot of time working on the @DevSkillDojo mockups using Balsamiq. Lesson, as always, before you jump into code/solution, spend time in the problem space to devise a plan of action.

**Thoughts:** After spending a bit more time on the mockups and user stories, I began to realise that while the web-scraping is important, it should not be the first priority

**Links:** N/A

### Day 59: 2020-06-19

**Today's Progress:**
Same as yesterday: Working through React/SpringBoot course. Also made significant progress on the mockups for the @DevSkillDojo MVP. Getting quite excited to begin coding this thing! 

**Thoughts:** MVP is not a walk in the park. There are quite a few things to be built before we can confidently begin showing this to people

**Links:** N/A

### Day 60: 2020-06-20

**Today's Progress:**
Still on the React journey. Arrow functions are still confusing me a bit - I will need to dig some more. 

**Thoughts:** In general, as someone who learnt to code in the good ol' days, I really find the concept of passing function references as parameters a bit weird.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 61: 2020-06-21

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the DevSkillDojo MVP mockups. Getting ready to switch gears to front-end development mode.  Also continued with the React/SpringBoot course

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 62: 2020-06-24
Finished the @DevSkillDojo MVP mockups in Balsamiq. Next step is to convert them to fully clickable HTML so that I begin to test the market. Very excited to see whether there is as much interest as I'm hoping for. React learning continuing as well. 

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 63: 2020-06-25
React, React, React. Spent some time reading the docs at https://reactjs.org/docs. Played around with BrowserRouter and the various optoins available.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 64: 2020-06-26
Still Reacting to the world around me. Played with links and beginning to incorporate CSS into the exploration. As an experienced "Maker of Lists", I spent an hour this morning listing and categorising all the CSS properties, so that I know where to focus my learning attention.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 65: 2020-06-27
Finished the obligatory ToDo list app front-end in React. Now assembling a SpringBoot back back-end, so I can link it all together.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A


### Day 66: 2020-06-28
Mamma mia. Just had a scuffle with the React BrowserRouter. It kept re-instantiating my components without approval from me! Thankfully I discovered 
a great article series by @learnwithparam at https://learnwithparam.com/blog/how-to-pass-props-in-react-router/ that nicely described the issue. TLDR; Use render props, not component props.

**Thoughts:** 
Learnt a ton so far. and getting very positive about the Component model that React uses. 

**Links:**
* https://alligator.io/react/constructors-with-react-components/
* https://learnwithparam.com/blog/how-to-pass-props-in-react-router/


### Day 67-68: 2020-07-02
Spent some time connecting my React front-end with the SpringBoot back end by using the Axios library. Was my first interaction with JavaScript promises, so it still feels a bit weird. But getting there, and certainly more elegant than the old-school JQuery Ajax method.

**Thoughts:** 
Definitely easier than JQuery

**Links:**

### Day 69: 2020-07-03
Explored some more details of the React component lifecycle while linking the front-end to the back-end. Will hopefully have the whole Todo app finished over the weekend, so we can start applying the knowledge gained.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 69: 2020-07-04
Finished all CRUD functionality on the ToDo app, using Formik forms in the process. Now just some some JWT security and JPA persistance and then I can say I've built my first full stack app using React and SpringBoot. Of course the style leaves much to be desired, but that'll come afterwards

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 70: 2020-07-05
Not a hugely productive day on the coding front. First got sidetracked with a DevSkillDojo blog, and then I began a deep dive into Spring Security, instead of just using the parts I need. But, still fun and valuable time spent

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 71: 2020-07-08
Added some basic authentication logic using Axios. I'm still on my Spring Security detour, but forced myself to just disable CSRF checking and move on with the React App :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 72: 2020-07-09
Finalised JWT authentication with Spring Security on the back-end and React on the front-end. Currently just using an in-memory list of users, but that will come soon :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 73: 2020-07-10
Finished the ToDo app with JPA persistence to an H2 in-memory DB. Now onto a private project

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 74: 2020-07-11
Started working on one of the back-end Microservices for the DevSkillDojo MVP. Just enough to allow me to link the React front-end to something real.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 75: 2020-07-12
Switched over to the @DevSkillDojo MVP front-end. Played around with Redux a bit, to determine if it's the right tool for the job. Is suspect it is, but, YOH, it's yet another deep rabbit hole.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 76: 2020-07-13
Wrangling with Redux. Spent some time ensuring the login state gets persisted (and retrieved from session storage if the user refresheds the browser). As expected, the rabbit hole is deep

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 77: 2020-07-14
Found a workaround to yesterday's redux issue, but it really feels like a hack. So I decided to take a step back and explore best practices for handling login state in a Redux application. And since my end-state is to use AWS Cognito, I'm using that for now.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 78: 2020-07-16
Client-side processing of login state finally working nicely using Redux and ReactRouter. Next up is linkiing to the Cognito back-end.

**Thoughts:** 
In the process came across Dan Abramov's explanations of Redux. Solid stuff:
* https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux
* https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux

Suspect I'mn gonna have to refactor my app onve I've worked through those, but I'm pushing ahead for now

**Links:**

### Day 79: 2020-07-17
Completed User registration and login functionality against AWS Cognito User Pool. Which means that my excuses for postponing the styling are rapidly running out :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 80: 2020-07-18
Added react front-end functionality for navigating through the hierarchy of teams that will be coming from the SpringBoot API. Pretty chuffed that I am starting to "get" Redux.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 81: 2020-07-19
Dayjob was a bit all-consuming, so I only continued my reading on CSS at MDN. Finished the Building Blocks section and started with Tect Styling

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**


### Day 82: 2020-07-20
Once again need to focus on the dayjob for the most part today, but I did spend time to create a stub user profile service in SpringBoot which will be called from React after the user is authenticated on Cognito. Will hopefully integrate into UI this evening

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 83: 2020-07-21
Very hard day at the office. When I tried to link up my React front-end to the REST service I got blocked by a CORS issue. Even though I had the CrossOrigin annotation on my controller. Gave up after about 20 minutes of struggling :(

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**


### Day 84: 2020-07-22
After I got up this morning, I saw that I typed the API URL wrong (localhost, instead of http://localhost), which was the cause of last night's inexplicable CORS error. Spent some time linking up the user profile page with the back-end, which included the creation of a user profile repository and some test data.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 85: 2020-07-23
Finally starting with the styling. Linked Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap and Sass. Starting to play around with some colours and images. This is, quite obviously, the area where my skills dry up very rapidly :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 86: 2020-07-24
With 13 days left, the structure is beginning to show :) Still lots to do though. Today I added the initial version of the Navbar using React-Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 87: 2020-07-25
Slept a bit later on the Saturday morning, and with house-chores looming, I didn't have much time for dev. Nonetheless, I got a start on the @DevSkillDojo landing page. Let's hope I find some more time later today

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 88: 2020-07-26
Finally happy with the landing page. Time to move on to meat and potatoes of the application. I'm thinking I'll first build it fully in React/Redux and then tie in the back-end afterwards. Forces me to focus on my weak point :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 89: 2020-08-10
Been 2 crazy weeks on the eastern front, so didn't have much time to work on side projects. However, I did finish the first version of the Innisfree Solutions website (Laboratory Technology business that I have a stake in). Also happened to be my first deployment to Netlify and it was such a breeze! Still some things I'd like to polish up, but it's online now. Here's the link: https://innisfree.tech/

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 90: 2020-08-12
Spent time tinkering with the viewport-specific padding for the Innisfree website (https://innisfree.tech/). Looks half-decent on mobile now, so I'll let it soak in the sun for a while. Finally time to get back to the @DevSkillDojo app.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 91: 2020-08-12
Build initial version of the Person screen for @DevSkillDojo. Just plain old React Bootstrap and Fontawesome at the moment. Also used the opportunity to introduce the useState hook (My first baby-step towards React Hooks).

**Thoughts:** 
Will definitely introduce React-Table next

**Links:**

### Day 92 and 93: 2020-08-15
Refactored the person table to use React-Table. This also included adding the row filtering and sorting.

**Thoughts:** 
Was a bit of a journey, because I needed to do a crash course in React hooks as well, but all worth it. Next step is to link up the back end. Don't really have a clue how the hooks will work with that...

**Links:**

### Day 94 and 95: 2020-08-17
Spent some time back in Java land, building the SpringBoot service that feeds the Person screen on the front-end. Lots of JPA plumbing still needed - so it will probably take another day or two.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 96: 2020-08-27
With MANY stops and starts, I've finally found time today to assemble the bits-and-bobs that make the front-end person grid link up the the Spring-boot back end. Next stop: Adding a person

**Thoughts:** 
I definitely think it's important to just get the CRUD stack streamlined before we build out all of the screens

**Links:**

### Day 97: 2020-09-02
Long day so far, trying to figure out the best approach for building a multi-select control in Formik. Just as I reached the home-straight, I discovered the react-select library. Sorted out all my issues :)

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 98: 2020-09-03
Fully integrated the person creation screen with the Spring Boot back end. Lots of polish still required though w.r.t exception handling, data validation and UX. But it works. And my mantra is always: First make it work, then make it right, then make it fast

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 99: 2020-09-04
Added Bean Validation to the person service in the back end. Also added additional checks for uniqueness constraint violations. On the front-end I added some Formik validations and error messages.

**Thoughts:** 

**Links:**

### Day 100: 2020-09-05
Built skeleton person detail page and linked it up to the people page. Fixed up the styling of the people page to use Bootstrap throughout

**Thoughts:** 
Learnt a ton of stuff over the last 100 days (which was just under 6 months, so more in the line of 150 days, but that's how it goes. Definitely fonna do another 100, but absolutely feeling for comfortable

**Links:**

### Day R2D1: 2020-09-06
Spent a lot of time working through a very valuable Formik tutorial from @CodevolutionWeb and am now starting to get more comfortable with the moving parts under the covers. Added editing capability via modal for basic person information

**Thoughts:** 
Starting to feel comfortable with Formik

### Day R2D2: 2020-09-07
Linked up the Mapped skills table on the person details page. Quite a lot of back-end work to get this tied together nicely - Even needed a minor adjustment on the domain model.

**Thoughts:** 
Need to expand my test data a little bit.

### Day R2D3: 2020-09-08
R2D3 #100DaysOfCode - Added search method to the Skills Ontology API and linked it up to the Skills Manager front-end using the rock-solid typeahead control from  Eric Giovanola (https://github.com/ericgio/react-bootstrap-typeahead)

**Thoughts:** 
Need to expand my test data a little bit.

### Day R2D4: 2020-09-09
R2D4 #100DaysOfCode - Built API method for adding a list of new skills to a person and linked up the front-end using an Axios call. Some finesse needed to ensure that the skill object from the Ontology microservice aligns with ther structure needed by the Skills Manager app

**Thoughts:** 
Took quite a bit longer than expected

### Day R2D5: 2020-09-10
R2D5 #100DaysOfCode - Added stub API method for adjusting proficiency levels on specific skills. Also prepared the UI model, but didn't get enough time to wire them up yet. Will take up that battle tomorrow.

### Day R2D6: 2020-09-12
R2D6 #100DaysOfCode - Wired up the proficiency adjustment functionality

### Day R2D7: 2020-09-14
R2D7 #100DaysOfCode - Added Reports page and began exploring authorisation for the back-end

### Day R2D8: 2020-09-15
R2D8 #100DaysOfCode - Added authorisation to the back-end using Spring security and AWS Cognito JWT tokens. Seems to work via Postman now, but still failing when calling via React

### Day R2D9: 2020-09-16
R2D9 #100DaysOfCode - Added Axios interceptor to add bearer token to all requests going to the server

### Day R2D10: 2020-09-17
R2D10 #100DaysOfCode - Adding organization registration

### Day R2D11: 2020-09-18
R2D11 #100DaysOfCode - Continued with organization registration

### Day R2D12: 2020-09-19
R2D12 #100DaysOfCode -  - Continued with organization registration (Mainly on linking the Cognito data with the Spring-boot back end)

### Day R2D13: 2020-09-20
R2D13 #100DaysOfCode - Continued with organization registration

### Day R2D14: 2020-09-21
R2D14 #100DaysOfCode - Removed hard-coded organization id from front-end. Started working on View Account Profile

### Day R2D15: 2020-09-22
R2D15 #100DaysOfCode - Spent most of the day refactoring back-end Spring controllers to ensure robust exception handling. Refactored where appropriate

### Day R2D16: 2020-09-23
R2D16 #100DaysOfCode - Added company account profile page. Also added user profile page and modal for changing basic user details. Was really focusing on data strcuture and redux flow, so styling still needs to be reworked.

### Day R2D17: 2020-09-24
R2D17 #100DaysOfCode - Finished change password functionality. In the process I introduced the React Context API to clean up some messy structures that were starting to develop. Just realised I probably need to add a Success notification though :)

### Day R2D18: 2020-09-25
R2D18 #100DaysOfCode - Began the exploration of platform choices for the skills repository. First up was Jekyll, which could be a very easy approach for storing the repository as pure markdown files on GitHub where anybody can make changes and submit PRs.

### Day R2D19: 2020-10-05
R2D19 #100DaysOfCode - After a week of chiling, I'm back at it. Spent a lot of time getting familiar with Gatsby and I'm thoroughly convinced it is the most appropriate solution for the @DevSkillDojo skills knowledgebase (Sorry Jekyll, I met someone else)

### Day R2D20: 2020-10-06
R2D20 #100DaysOfCode - Spent some time playing with Snipcart to add shopping cart capability to a Gatsby site, as well as using Netlify for JWT-based authentication on Gatsby site. Now onto the meat and potatoes

### Day R2D21: 2020-10-07
R2D21 #100DaysOfCode - Assembled the skeleton site for the @DevSkillDojo skills repository. Styling still to come. Essentially the goal of the repository is to allow people to explore the details of individual skills, but also the dependencies between skills.

### Day R2D22: 2020-10-08
R2D22 #100DaysOfCode - Stripped out default Gatsby styling and replaced with React-Bootstrap. Hopefully there'll be enough content to share before the end of the weekend

### Day R2D23-24: 2020-10-10
R2D23-24 #100DaysOfCode - Added styling to the blog page, also built the styled skeleton of the skills repository page. Still a way to go, but we're chugging along :)

### Day R2D25: 2020-10-12
R2D25 #100DaysOfCode - After much deliberation, I've decided to drop Neo4J from the @DevSkillDojo tech stack and rather switch to DynamoDB. For my requirements it is just a better fit. Been digging into DynamoDB by working on https://www.dynamodbguide.com/ 

### Day R2D26-27: 2020-10-16
R2D26-27 #100DaysOfCode - Implemented the first try of the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology on DynamoDB. Needed to get familiar with the AWS Python SDK in the process. Also realised that to enable advanced skills searching I'd need to create an ElasticSearch index of the ontology. 

### Day R2D28-29: 2020-10-19
R2D28-29 #100DaysOfCode - Still struggling to get AWS Lambda function to successfully pull data from DynamoDB stream and push to ElasticSearch. Seems my IAM knowledge needs some work :)
Also played with ODK for the lab side, and was very impressed.

### Day R2D30: 2020-10-20
R2D30 #100DaysOfCode - finally figured out the last piece of the puzzle needed to build, index and search the skills ontology on AWS. This includes:
- Writing the ontology record to DynamoDB
- Reading the DynamoDB stream with a Lambda Function
- Putting the ontology record on ElasticSearch cluster from the Lambda function

Now to assemble the parts

### Day R2D31: 2020-10-21
R2D31 #100DaysOfCode - Built Boto3 (AWS Python SDK) script that provisions (and destroys) DynamoDB, IAM Policies and Roles. Next up: Creating and deploying a Lambda function from the Boto3 script

### Day R2D32-34: 2020-10-25
R2D32-34 #100DaysOfCode - Updated Boto3 script to deploy (and destroy) Lambda function which reads DynamoDB stream and updated ES index. Lots of lessons learnt about IAM, ES and Lambda along the way :) 

### Day R2D35: 2020-10-26
R2D35 #100DaysOfCode - Added Lambda function for searching against the skills index in ElasticSearch. Next step is to expose it via AWS API Gateway, and then finally, FINALLY I can get back to the front-end which needs to use the search capability

### Day R2D35: 2020-10-26
R2D35 #100DaysOfCode - Added Lambda function for searching against the skills index in ElasticSearch. Next step is to expose it via AWS API Gateway, and then finally, FINALLY I can get back to the front-end which needs to use the search capability

### Day R2D36: 2020-10-28
R2D36 #100DaysOfCode - Built and deployed REST API via AWS API Gateway. Currently just updating Boto3 scripts to fully bootstrap the entire @DevSkillDojo skills ontology platform. This includes DynamoDB, Various Lambda functions, ElasticSearch domain, SQS queues, REST APIs and the IAM configs holding them together.

### Day R2D37: 2020-11-05
R2D37 #100DaysOfCode - After a week time spent on other I got back into the game with @devSkillDojo development. Fixed some shortcomings on the Boto3 script that provisions the search API on AWS API Gateway. Key lesson: Working with the API helps you understand AWS services a lot better than simply working in the console

### Day R2D38-39: 2020-11-09
R2D38-39 #100DaysOfCode - Yippee! Three weeks after I decided to pivot from a custom Neo4J deployment to a serverless AWS stack for the Skills Ontology (What I thought would be a 2-day detour), today I finally linked up the @DevSkillDojo UI to the Ontology Search API. Been a journey, but have been very impressed with AWS.

### Day R2D40: 2020-11-10
R2D40 #100DaysOfCode - Aligned test data on Dynamo/ElasticSearch ontology with the Markdown files used by the repository web app. Two critical next steps now: Ensure the rendered HTML from markdown files look half-decent, and create data loader which populated DynamodDb from the Markdown data. Gonna be an interesting week.

### Day R2D41: 2020-11-11
R2D41 #100DaysOfCode - Spent the morning on minor adjustments to the DynamoDB data model and the corresponding markdown file format. At this stage I will be able to dynamically populate the ontolodgy using only front-matter from the markdown file. Will look at that tomorrow..

### Day R2D42: 2020-11-12
R2D42 #100DaysOfCode - Battling a bit with the mindshift from a typical Relational design to "Single-Table" design with DynamoDB

### Day R2D43: 2020-11-16
R2D43 #100DaysOfCode - Played aroud with Boto3's query method (instead of get_item) to find and and update eixsting skills in the DynamoDB table. To anyone comaning into DynamoDb from a relational background, I'd advise having a look at this talk by Alex DeBrie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIQVJqiSUkE 

### Day R2D44: 2020-11-17
R2D44 #100DaysOfCode - Added python method to parse a markdown file, pull the frontmatter, calculate the ontologyId and then load to DynamoDB. Next up: Stepping through a directory tree, loading all the skills into the ontology. 

### Day R2D45: 2020-11-18
R2D45 #100DaysOfCode - Wrapped up the generation of all skills pages from the directory of markdown files. Finally started moving back into Gatsby work by moving content from my old Ghost blog into the new Gatsby version. Should hopefully be a matter of days before I can migrate the live site.

### Day R2D46-49: 2020-11-23
R2D46-49 #100DaysOfCode - Still busy migrating markdown from Ghost to Gatsby. About 60% done. In the meantime, I've decided to begin working on the content for the first post that is planned for the new Gatsby blog - A week-long public learning exercise focussed on AWS CloudFront. Join me at @DevSkillDojo if you're keen

### Day R2D50-51: 2020-11-25
R2D50-51 #100DaysOfCode - At last I've managed to convert all the old Ghost blog posts to pure markdown. Still not 100% happy with the styling, but it'll have to do for now. MVP, as they say... Targeting deployment to prod this Friday :)

### Day R2D52: 2020-12-01
R2D52 #100DaysOfCode - Moved last bits of content over to the new Gatsby site. Commented sections out that are not ready for the live site. Deployed to S3 using gatsby-s3-plugin. Will wrap the CloudFront tomorrow. For now, here's the link: http://www.devskilldojo.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

### Day R2D53: 2020-12-02
R2D53 #100DaysOfCode - Replaced default Gatsby footer with something more appropriate. Also added skeleton pages for each of the footer links. Succeeded in getting my TLS certificate issued through AWS Certificate Manager. Hopefully I can do a full deploy today.
