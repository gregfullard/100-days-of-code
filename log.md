# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2020-03-09

**Today's Progress:** 
Worked through Basic creating a website tutorial on LevelUpTuts' YouTube channel. Began building dummy landing page for LunchTimeLearning.tech

**Thoughts:** Feels weird to be such a beginner at front-end dev work.

### Day 2,3,4,5: 2020-03-14

**Today's Progress:** 
After a series of 16-hour days at the office, I was a bit behind on my 100 day coding. Caught up today by starting to work through the Gatsby tutorial. Lesson 1-4 complete and I am hooked.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of moving parts under the covers of React. I will definitely need to get a more fundamental understanding of the vanilla JS environment to really understand what is going on.

### Day 6: 2020-03-15

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Gatsby tutorial. With various digressions along the way.

**Thoughts:** Realised, yet again, that there is a ton of stuff that happened in the Javascript world over the last few years while I was stuck in Java-land. The front-end journey is looking exciting.

### Day 7, 8: 2020-03-17

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Responsive Web Design challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Now onto the projects.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid is really cool, but I'm struggling to fully graph when you would use flexbox and when CSS grid is more appropriate.

### Day 9, 10: 2020-03-19

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Tribute project (project 1 of 5) in the Responsive Web Design section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Jeepers, I needed to reference back to the material for almost everything.

### Day 11: 2020-03-20

**Today's Progress:**
Started basic Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running through them quickly, but actually learned a few things along the way. Just proves that you can always learn more.

### Day 12 & 13: 2020-03-22

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the landing page for LunchTimeLearning. Now onto the other pages: About, FAQ and Credits

**Thoughts:** Still a slow struggle, but was greatly helped by Gary Simon's videos on YouTube. Really think I should consider building a basic web page almost every day to get used to the various effects of CSS

### Day 14: 2020-03-23

**Today's Progress:**
Got to 80/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running as fast as I can, all quite basic up to now

### Day 15: 2020-03-25

**Today's Progress:**
 Took yesterday off due to all the trauma related to the national lockdown. Back at it today though. Got to 101/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still very basic, but starting to have to think before I type. I like it.

### Day 16-18: 2020-03-28

**Today's Progress:**
Built the survey form project in the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert.

**Thoughts:** Building the form to pass the tests was very easy, but it took me quite a while to get the styling acceptable. Still a long road ahead before I feel comfortable on the front-end

### Day 19: 2020-03-29

**Today's Progress:**
Finally got going on Neo4J. 

**Thoughts:** After much deliberation, I decided to select Neo4J as the database for the skills ontology I'm building for LunchTimeLearning. Other main candidate was JCR.

### Day 20: 2020-04-01

**Today's Progress:**
Progressed with Neo4J

**Thoughts:** After a 2-day hold-up was finally able to spend sopme time on this project. Starting to grash Cypher queries used in Neo4J.

### Day 21: 2020-04-02

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the Neo4J course, but started building the skills ontology using Cypher

**Thoughts:** Will be some time before I'm an absolute expert, but Neo4J is extremely intuitive

### Day 22: 2020-04-03

**Today's Progress:**
Slow day, started working through @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges

**Thoughts:** Gonna need to do a lot of ES6 coding before this comes naturally to me.

### Day 23: 2020-04-04

**Today's Progress:**
Finished @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges. Lots of work on the Neo4J skills ontology for @DevSkillDojo.

**Thoughts:** Really suffering from shiny object syndrome, and struggling to get into a real flow state

### Day 24: 2020-04-05

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. finished the section on advanced Cycpher queries and now moving onto creating nodes and relationships.

**Thoughts:** Although Cypher is quite different from SQL, the best way to understand Cypher is to map the concepts to similar concepts in SQL.

### Day 25: 2020-04-07

**Today's Progress:**
Missed a day, but continuing with the @Neo4J course. Finished section 7 (Creating data). Now finally onto the last section before I can feel reasonably comfortable to actually build stuff.

**Thoughts:** Some days I'm really struggling to find time and motivation. Often I have one or the other. But having both is rare.

### Day 26: 2020-04-08

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. Looked at analysing queries with EXPLAIN and PROFILE. 

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the query to terminate from the second browser

### Day 27-28: 2020-04-10

**Today's Progress:**
With many stops and starts I finally completed the @Neo4J course. Ready to start using it properly

**Thoughts:** Just happy to be done

### Day 29: 2020-04-16

**Today's Progress:**
Took some days off to recover my Mojo. Spent this morning assembling the skeleton Cypher script for the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** As always, once you build your own stuff, you immediately notice the gaps in your knowledge, but this is a great way to learn more.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 30: 2020-04-17

**Today's Progress:**
Added the first proper graph relationships to the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** Baby steps

**Links:** N/A

### Day 31: 2020-04-18

**Today's Progress:**
Built a basic SpringBoot REST service which accesses the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology using Spring Data and the @Neo4J OGM Bolt driver.

**Thoughts:** The level of standardisation that Spring Data has brought to the party is really making polyglot persistence a reality

**Links:** N/A

### Day 32: 2020-04-19

**Today's Progress:**
Adding support for POST requests in the skills ontology service. Also added a Postman project to make consistent testing a bit easier.

**Thoughts:** Pulling relationships from the Neo4J graph is not working as expected yet, but will figure it out tomorrow

**Links:** N/A
