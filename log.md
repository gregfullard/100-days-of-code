# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2020-03-09

**Today's Progress:** 
Worked through Basic creating a website tutorial on LevelUpTuts' YouTube channel. Began building dummy landing page for LunchTimeLearning.tech

**Thoughts:** Feels weird to be such a beginner at front-end dev work.

### Day 2,3,4,5: 2020-03-14

**Today's Progress:** 
After a series of 16-hour days at the office, I was a bit behind on my 100 day coding. Caught up today by starting to work through the Gatsby tutorial. Lesson 1-4 complete and I am hooked.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of moving parts under the covers of React. I will definitely need to get a more fundamental understanding of the vanilla JS environment to really understand what is going on.

### Day 6: 2020-03-15

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Gatsby tutorial. With various digressions along the way.

**Thoughts:** Realised, yet again, that there is a ton of stuff that happened in the Javascript world over the last few years while I was stuck in Java-land. The front-end journey is looking exciting.

### Day 7, 8: 2020-03-17

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Responsive Web Design challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Now onto the projects.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid is really cool, but I'm struggling to fully graph when you would use flexbox and when CSS grid is more appropriate.

### Day 9, 10: 2020-03-19

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Tribute project (project 1 of 5) in the Responsive Web Design section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Jeepers, I needed to reference back to the material for almost everything.

### Day 11: 2020-03-20

**Today's Progress:**
Started basic Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running through them quickly, but actually learned a few things along the way. Just proves that you can always learn more.

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 12 & 13: 2020-03-22

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the landing page for LunchTimeLearning. Now onto the other pages: About, FAQ and Credits

**Thoughts:** Still a slow struggle, but was greatly helped by Gary Simon's videos on YouTube. Really think I should consider building a basic web page almost every day to get used to the various effects of CSS

### Day 14: 2020-03-23

**Today's Progress:**
Got to 80/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running as fast as I can, all quite basic up to now

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 15: 2020-03-25

**Today's Progress:**
 Took yesterday off due to all the trauma related to the national lockdown. Back at it today though. Got to 101/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still very basic, but starting to have to think before I type. I like it.

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

### Day 16-18: 2020-03-28

**Today's Progress:**
Built the survey form project in the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert.

**Thoughts:** Building the form to pass the tests was very easy, but it took me quite a while to get the styling acceptable. Still a long road ahead before I feel comfortable on the front-end

### Day 19: 2020-03-29

**Today's Progress:**
Finally got going on Neo4J. 

**Thoughts:** After much deliberation, I decided to select Neo4J as the database for the skills ontology I'm building for LunchTimeLearning. Other main candidate was JCR. 

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 20: 2020-04-01

**Today's Progress:**
Progressed with Neo4J

**Thoughts:** After a 2-day hold-up was finally able to spend sopme time on this project. Starting to grash Cypher queries used in Neo4J.  

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 21: 2020-04-02

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the Neo4J course, but started building the skills ontology using Cypher

**Thoughts:** Will be some time before I'm an absolute expert, but Neo4J is extremely intuitive  

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 22: 2020-04-03

**Today's Progress:**
Slow day, started working through @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges

**Thoughts:** Gonna need to do a lot of ES6 coding before this comes naturally to me. 

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6

### Day 23: 2020-04-04

**Today's Progress:**
Finished @FreeCodeCamp ES6 challenges. Lots of work on the Neo4J skills ontology for @DevSkillDojo.

**Thoughts:** Really suffering from shiny object syndrome, and struggling to get into a real flow state 

**Links:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6

### Day 24: 2020-04-05

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. finished the section on advanced Cycpher queries and now moving onto creating nodes and relationships.

**Thoughts:** Although Cypher is quite different from SQL, the best way to understand Cypher is to map the concepts to similar concepts in SQL.

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 25: 2020-04-07

**Today's Progress:**
Missed a day, but continuing with the @Neo4J course. Finished section 7 (Creating data). Now finally onto the last section before I can feel reasonably comfortable to actually build stuff.

**Thoughts:** Some days I'm really struggling to find time and motivation. Often I have one or the other. But having both is rare.

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 26: 2020-04-08

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing with the @Neo4J course. Looked at analysing queries with EXPLAIN and PROFILE. 

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the query to terminate from the second browser

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 27-28: 2020-04-10

**Today's Progress:**
With many stops and starts I finally completed the @Neo4J course. Ready to start using it properly

**Thoughts:** Just happy to be done

**Links:** https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j/

### Day 29: 2020-04-16

**Today's Progress:**
Took some days off to recover my Mojo. Spent this morning assembling the skeleton Cypher script for the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** As always, once you build your own stuff, you immediately notice the gaps in your knowledge, but this is a great way to learn more.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 30: 2020-04-17

**Today's Progress:**
Added the first proper graph relationships to the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology.

**Thoughts:** Baby steps

**Links:** N/A

### Day 31: 2020-04-18

**Today's Progress:**
Built a basic SpringBoot REST service which accesses the @DevSkillDojo skills ontology using Spring Data and the @Neo4J OGM Bolt driver.

**Thoughts:** The level of standardisation that Spring Data has brought to the party is really making polyglot persistence a reality

**Links:** N/A

### Day 32: 2020-04-19

**Today's Progress:**
Adding support for POST requests in the skills ontology service. Also added a Postman project to make consistent testing a bit easier.

**Thoughts:** Pulling relationships from the Neo4J graph is not working as expected yet, but will figure it out tomorrow

**Links:** N/A

### Day 33: 2020-04-20

**Today's Progress:**
Added SpringBoot REST methods for creating new skills (with specified perspective and parent). Also resolved issue which caused relationships not to serialize correctly to JSON.

**Thoughts:** as with all Object to JSON serialisation, there is a risk of massive trees of JSON going back. I might really need to investigate GraphQL instead of REST

**Links:** N/A

### Day 34: 2020-04-21

**Today's Progress:**
Refactored SpringBoot skills API slightly. Nothing earth-shaking, but cleaning up controllers and PathParams. Also changed the domain model slightly to allow the specification of prerequisite skills.

**Thoughts:** Need to work through a REST best practices book at some stage, just to ensure I'm doing things in the best possible way.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 35: 2020-04-22

**Today's Progress:**
Spent an hour trying to figure out why Spring Data Neo4J was not pulling related objects from the graph. And and just after posting to the newbie forum, I realised that the Cypher query did not return the relationship. Luckily they forum offers a delete option :)

**Thoughts:** Easy in the end, but weird how one starts doubting your own capabilities.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 36: 2020-04-23

**Today's Progress:**
Adding API method to create skills along with prerequisite skills, based on the weak-prerequisite relationship in the domain model.

**Thoughts:** Just a few more API method to go and then we can get into the Python side of things. Whoop whoop.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 37 & 38: 2020-04-25

**Today's Progress:**
Adding CRUD API methods for all lookup lists. Also began working on API method for registering learning resource providers and content creators.

**Thoughts:** Weird issue with handling Object Graph Mapping for recursive relationships. Need to dig a bit deeper.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 39 & 40: 2020-04-27

**Today's Progress:**
Finished all API methods for the skills ontology microservice. Next up is the Python code to begin populating this @Neo4J graph. Can't wait to see it running.

**Thoughts:** Might be necessary to change around the directions of relationships when I get more familiar with the domain model

**Links:** N/A

### Day 41 & 42: 2020-04-29

**Today's Progress:**
Following 2 solid days of coding I have completed most of the Python data upload scripts. In the process needed to refactor quite a number of the skills microservice methods. Just one more to go, let's hope the motivation lasts :)

**Thoughts:** Most complex of the lot now remains, and once I start building the web scraping it is very likely that the CSV formats will need to change.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 43 & 44: 2020-05-01

**Today's Progress:**
Another 2 days of pretty solid coding and I have finally completed the Python data upload scripts. Now I can begin populating the data sheets (manually and by web scraping) to build a comprehensive directory of technical skills and related learning resources.

**Thoughts:** Before I get lost in Web scraping, I should first build out the first set of data by hand. Just in case there are still minor adjustments needed in the model.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 45 & 46: 2020-05-03

**Today's Progress:**
Took it a bit easiers over the weekend. Started to clean up my @Neo4J data loading scripts and also got half-way with the regular expressions challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** None, really

**Links:** N/A

### Day 47 & 48: 2020-05-05

**Today's Progress:**
Finished regular expressions challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Also circled back to the Responsive Web Design Projects. Still need to finish 3.

**Thoughts:** My goodness, seems I have forgetten everything about CSS again :( And after a short stint on the back-end

**Links:** N/A

### Day 49: 2020-05-06

**Today's Progress:**
Still busy with the Project Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp. Struggling a bit to find sufficient time to really focus at the moment. HTML markup finished at least, but CSS file is still empty

**Thoughts:** To get good at this I will need to: Compile my own cheat sheets, Build at least one website per week

**Links:** N/A

### Day 50: 2020-05-22

**Today's Progress:**
After two weeks of absolute chaos with work and back-office finance, I am finally getting back on the horse by just doing random practice with creating pure HTML and CSS layouts. 

**Thoughts:** I want to get to the point that front-end markup and styling comes just as naturally as chirning out Java code

**Links:** N/A

### Day 51: 2020-06-11

**Today's Progress:**
Got back on the horse with the Ontology. Mainly just updating the readme and getting the solution to build

**Thoughts:** Realised the value of a good readme file for side-projects, because when you get back to a code-base for the first time in 3 weeks, you DO NOT want to spend the first hour just remembering how to bootstrap the app.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 52: 2020-06-12

**Today's Progress:**
Built a basic web scraper using Selenium for Java. 

**Thoughts:** Initially tried using JSoup, which is a Java port of the Python Beautiful Soup library. But had some issues with dynamically loaded page content, so then I switched to Selenium.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 53: 2020-06-13

**Today's Progress:**
Expanded the web scraper to be more robust, including catering for Udemy's blue-green deployment which returns different page layouts at random. Also writing the results into CSV

**Thoughts:** Lots of complexity with web scraping when data is loaded at runtime with Ajax calls

**Links:** N/A

### Day 54: 2020-06-14

**Today's Progress:**
Added some polish and then ran the web scraper the the "full" list of Udemy development courses. 

**Thoughts:** Final results successful, but it seems like they only show the first 10 000 records. Next step would be to do the searching/scraping at a more graunlar level and then aggregate the results. But still, quite chuffed that my code ran for 30 minutes, going through 625 pages and 10625 divs without a single exception.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 55: 2020-06-15

**Today's Progress:**
Ported the scraper over to a SpringBoot console app. Also improved logging and the ability to scrape individual Udemy categories and then aggregate them.

**Thoughts:** Scraped 21719 courses in 2.5 hours until the process terminated because it exceeded the configured number of errors allowed by the algorithm. Will run it overnight will a large number of allowed errors, just to see the total, but it seems like there are at least 40 000 courses on Udemy

**Links:** N/A

### Day 56: 2020-06-16

**Today's Progress:**
Switched track a little bit today and began working on some basic UI views for the ontology. Nothing fancy for now, just some SpringMVC with Thymeleaf templates

**Thoughts:** First time I've really done something with Thymeleaf and it is very similar to sightly

**Links:** N/A


### Day 57: 2020-06-17

**Today's Progress:**
Continuing on the UI effort, but kinda decided to use this opportunity to build some React skills as well. So I found a fandy course covering ful stack development using SpringBoot and React. Gonna take a few days to work through it fully, but seems like the type of content I need

**Thoughts:** N/A

**Links:** N/A

### Day 58: 2020-06-18

**Today's Progress:**
In addition to proceeding well on my SpringBoot/React learning, I've been spending a lot of time working on the @DevSkillDojo mockups using Balsamiq. Lesson, as always, before you jump into code/solution, spend time in the problem space to devise a plan of action.

**Thoughts:** After spending a bit more time on the mockups and user stories, I began to realise that while the web-scraping is important, it should not be the first priority

**Links:** N/A

### Day 59: 2020-06-19

**Today's Progress:**
Same as yesterday: Working through React/SpringBoot course. Also made significant progress on the mockups for the @DevSkillDojo MVP. Getting quite excited to begin coding this thing! 

**Thoughts:** MVP is not a walk in the park. There are quite a few things to be built before we can confidently begin showing this to people

**Links:** N/A

### Day 60: 2020-06-20

**Today's Progress:**
Still on the React journey. Arrow functions are still confusing me a bit - I will need to dig some more. 

**Thoughts:** In general, as someone who learnt to code in the good ol' days, I really find the concept of passing function references as parameters a bit weird.

**Links:** N/A

### Day 61: 2020-06-21

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the DevSkillDojo MVP mockups. Getting ready to switch gears to front-end development mode.  Also continued with the React/SpringBoot course

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 62: 2020-06-24
Finished the @DevSkillDojo MVP mockups in Balsamiq. Next step is to convert them to fully clickable HTML so that I begin to test the market. Very excited to see whether there is as much interest as I'm hoping for. React learning continuing as well. 

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 63: 2020-06-25
React, React, React. Spent some time reading the docs at https://reactjs.org/docs. Played around with BrowserRouter and the various optoins available.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 64: 2020-06-26
Still Reacting to the world around me. Played with links and beginning to incorporate CSS into the exploration. As an experienced "Maker of Lists", I spent an hour this morning listing and categorising all the CSS properties, so that I know where to focus my learning attention.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A

### Day 65: 2020-06-27
Finished the obligatory ToDo list app front-end in React. Now assembling a SpringBoot back back-end, so I can link it all together.

**Thoughts:**

**Links:** N/A
