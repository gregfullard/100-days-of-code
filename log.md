# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2020-03-09

**Today's Progress:** 
Worked through Basic creating a website tutorial on LevelUpTuts' YouTube channel. Began building dummy landing page for LunchTimeLearning.tech

**Thoughts:** Feels weird to be such a beginner at front-end dev work.

### Day 2,3,4,5: 2020-03-14

**Today's Progress:** 
After a series of 16-hour days at the office, I was a bit behind on my 100 day coding. Caught up today by starting to work through the Gatsby tutorial. Lesson 1-4 complete and I am hooked.

**Thoughts:** There's a lot of moving parts under the covers of React. I will definitely need to get a more fundamental understanding of the vanilla JS environment to really understand what is going on.

### Day 6: 2020-03-15

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Gatsby tutorial. With various digressions along the way.

**Thoughts:** Realised, yet again, that there is a ton of stuff that happened in the Javascript world over the last few years while I was stuck in Java-land. The front-end journey is looking exciting.

### Day 7, 8: 2020-03-17

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Responsive Web Design challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Now onto the projects.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid is really cool, but I'm struggling to fully graph when you would use flexbox and when CSS grid is more appropriate.

### Day 9, 10: 2020-03-19

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the Tribute project (project 1 of 5) in the Responsive Web Design section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Jeepers, I needed to reference back to the material for almost everything.

### Day 11: 2020-03-20

**Today's Progress:**
Started basic Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running through them quickly, but actually learned a few things along the way. Just proves that you can always learn more.

### Day 12 & 13: 2020-03-22

**Today's Progress:**
Finished the landing page for LunchTimeLearning. Now onto the other pages: About, FAQ and Credits

**Thoughts:** Still a slow struggle, but was greatly helped by Gary Simon's videos on YouTube. Really think I should consider building a basic web page almost every day to get used to the various effects of CSS

### Day 14: 2020-03-23

**Today's Progress:**
Got to 80/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Running as fast as I can, all quite basic up to now

### Day 15: 2020-03-25

**Today's Progress:**
 Took yesterday off due to all the trauma related to the national lockdown. Back at it today though. Got to 101/110 on the Javascript challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Still very basic, but starting to have to think before I type. I like it.

### Day 16-18: 2020-03-28

**Today's Progress:**
Built the survey form project in the @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design cert.

**Thoughts:** Building the form to pass the tests was very easy, but it took me quite a while to get the styling acceptable. Still a long road ahead before I feel compartable on the front-end
